If you have some work to do, I would strongly advise you to come back here some other time. ツ

* <a href="https://xkcd.com/" target="_blank"><font color="1DA1F2">XKCD</font></a>: Where your thoughts are put into webcomic. Of course you already know it.
* <a href="http://phdcomics.com/" target="_blank"><font color="1DA1F2">Ph.D. Comic</font></a>: Ever wondered about academic life? Need some confirmations or testimonials? I think Ph.D. Comic does a pretty good job at it.
