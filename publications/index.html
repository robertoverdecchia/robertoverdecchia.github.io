With the ever-growing adoption of AI-based systems, the carbon
footprint of AI is no longer negligible. AI researchers and practitioners are therefore urged to hold themselves accountable for the carbon emissions of the AI models they design and use. This led in recent years to the appearance of researches tackling AI environmental sustainability, a field referred to as Green AI. Despite the rapid growth of interest in the topic, a comprehensive overview of Green AI research is to date still missing. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a systematic review of the Green AI literature. From the analysis of 98 primary studies, different patterns emerge. The topic experienced a considerable growth from 2020 onward. Most studies consider monitoring AI model footprint, tuning hyperparameters to improve model sustainability, or benchmarking models. A mix of position papers, observational studies, and solution papers are present. Most papers focus on the training phase, are algorithm-agnostic or study neural networks, and use image data. Laboratory experiments are the most common research strategy. Reported Green AI energy savings go up to 115%, with savings over 50% being rather common. Industrial parties are involved in Green AI studies, albeit most target academic readers. Green AI tool provisioning is scarce. As a conclusion, the Green AI research field results to have reached a considerable level of maturity. Therefore, from this review emerges that the time is suitable to adopt other Green AI research strategies, and port the numerous promising academic results to industrial practice.

Over the years, various thinking frameworks have been developed to address sustainability as a quality property of software-intensive systems. Notwithstanding, which quality concerns should be selected in practice that have a significant impact on sustainability remains a challenge.<br>
In this experience report, we propose the notion of variability features, i.e., specific software features which are implemented in a number of possible alternative variants, each with a potentially different impact on sustainability. We extended sustainability decision maps to incorporate these variability features into an already existing thinking framework. Our findings were derived from a qualitative case study and evaluated in an industrial context. Data was collected by analysing a real-world application and conducting working sessions together with expert interviews.<br>
The variability features allowed us to identify and evaluate alternative usage scenarios of one real-world software-intensive system, enabling data-driven sustainability choices and suggestions for professional practices. By providing concrete measurements, we can support software architects at design time, and decision makers towards achieving sustainability goals.

Contribution: This paper contributes empirical insights on hybrid teaching of software engineering courses. Results include the systematic analysis of hybrid teaching attendance and interaction, perception of hybrid teaching, and grade distributions. Results are synthesised into eight evidence-based guidelines.<br>
Background: Hybrid teaching, i.e., teaching simultaneously to in-person and online students, is gaining an increasing adoption. However, how to improve the experience of students with respect to hybrid teaching is still an open question.<br>
Research questions: RQ: How can the experience of students with respect to hybrid teaching be improved? RQ1: Are there differences between in-person and online student attendance and interaction? RQ2: What is the student perception of hybrid teaching? RQ3: Is in-person and online supervision influencing grades of students?<br>
Methodology: A mixed-method empirical research process is used, by considering two Master courses in software engineering. The process leverages three data sources, namely quantitative and qualitative data collected during lectures, a student survey, and student grades. Summary statistics, coding processes, and a statistical analysis are used to answer the research questions.<br>
Findings: Students prefer to attend more frequently online, as it provides (among other factors) flexibility and convenience, while coming at the cost of lower focus and interaction quality. Following in-person is statistically a better choice to gain a median grade, while following online can lead with more probability to a higher or lower grade. Various guidelines are presented, ranging from hybrid classroom setup, to online student management, and course component design.

  Background: Numerous methodologies have been used to study technical debt. Among different data sources, Q&A sites provide an opportunity to study how users reference and request support on technical debt. To date only few studies, focusing on narrow aspects, investigate technical debt through the lens of Stack Overflow.<br>
  Aims: We aim at gaining an in-depth understanding on the characteristics of technical debt questions on Stack Overflow. In addition, we assess if identification strategies based on machine learning can be used to automatically identify and classify technical debt questions.<br>
  Method: We use combination of automated and manual processes to identify technical debt questions on Stack Overflow. The final set of 415 questions is analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively to study (i) technical debt types, (ii) question length, (iii) perceived urgency, (iv) sentiment, and (v) emerging themes. Natural language processing and machine learning techniques are used to evaluate if technical debt questions can be identified and classified automatically.<br>
  Results: Architecture debt is the most recurring debt type, followed by code and design debt. Most questions display mild urgency, with the frequency of higher urgency steadily declining as urgency rises. Question length varies across debt types. Sentiment of questions is mostly neutral. 29 recurrent themes emerge in the questions. Machine learning models can be used to identify technical debt questions and binary urgency accurately, but not debt types.<br>
  Conclusions: Different patterns emerge from the analysis of technical debt questions on Stack Overflow. The results provide further insights on the phenomenon, and support the adoption of a more comprehensive strategy to identify technical debt questions.

  Background: Digital infrastructures, i.e., ICT systems, or system-of-systems, providing digital capabilities, such as storage and computational services, are experiencing an ever-growing demand for data consumption, which is only expected to increase in the future. This trend leads to a question we need to answer: How can we evolve digital infrastructures to keep up with the increasing data demand in a sustainable way?<br>

  Objective: The goal of this study is to understand what is the future of sustainable digital infrastructures, in terms of: which solutions are, or will be, available to sustainably evolve digital infrastructures, and which are the related adoption factors, impediments, and open problems.<br>

  Method: We carried out a 3-phase mixed-method qualitative empirical study, comprising semi-structured interviews, followed by focus groups, and a plenary session with parallel working groups. In total, we conducted 13 sessions involving 48 digital infrastructure practitioners and researchers.<br>

  Results: From our investigation emerges a landscape for sustainable digital infrastructures, composed of 30 solutions, 5 adoption factors, 4 impediments, and 13 open problems. We further synthesized our results in 4 incremental scenarios, which outline the future evolution of sustainable digital infrastructures.<br>

  Conclusions: From an initial shift from on-premise to the cloud, as time progresses, digital infrastructures are expected to become increasingly distributed, till it will be possible to dynamically allocate resources by following time, space, and energy. Numerous solutions will support this change, but digital infrastructures are envisaged to be able to evolve sustainably only by (i) gaining a wider awareness of digital sustainability, (ii) holding every party accountable for their sustainability throughout value chains, and (iii) establishing cross-domain collaborations.</div>

    With the growing availability of large-scale datasets, and the popularization of affordable storage and computational capabilities, the energy consumed by AI is becoming a growing
concern. To address this issue, in recent years, studies have focused on demonstrating how AI energy efficiency can be improved by tuning the model training strategy. Nevertheless, how modifications applied to datasets can impact the energy consumption of AI is still an open question. To fill this gap, in this exploratory study, we evaluate if data-
centric approaches can be utilized to improve AI energy efficiency. To achieve our goal, we conduct an empirical experiment, executed by considering 6 different AI algorithms, a dataset comprising 5,574 data points, and two dataset modifications (number of data points and number of features). Our results show evidence that, by exclusively conducting modifications on datasets, energy consumption can be drastically reduced (up to 92.16%), often at the cost of a negligible or even absent accuracy decline. As additional introductory results, we demonstrate how, by exclusively changing the algorithm used, energy savings up to two orders of magnitude can be achieved. In conclusion, this exploratory investigation empirically demonstrates the importance of applying data-centric techniques to improve AI energy efficiency. Our results call for a research agenda that focuses on data-centric techniques, to further enable and democratize Green AI.</div>

    Background
    Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) in a software-intensive system denotes architectural design choices which, while being suitable or even optimal when adopted, lower the maintainability and evolvability of the system in the long term, hindering future development activities. Despite the growing research interest in ATD, how to gain an informative and encompassing viewpoint of the ATD present in a software-intensive system is still an open problem.
    
    Objective
    In this study, we evaluate ATDx, a data-driven approach providing an overview of the ATD present in a software-intensive system. The approach, based on the analysis of a software portfolio, calculates severity levels of architectural rule violations via a clustering algorithm, and aggregates results into different ATD dimensions.
    
    Method
    To evaluate ATDx, we implement an instance of the approach based on SonarQube, and run the analysis on the Apache and ONAP ecosystems. The analysis results are then shared with the portfolio contributors, who are invited to participate in an online survey designed to evaluate the representativeness and actionability of the approach.
    
    Results
    The survey results confirm the representativeness of the ATDx, in terms of both the ATDx analysis results and the used architectural technical debt dimensions. Results also showed the actionability of the approach, although to a lower extent when compared to the ATDx representativeness, with usage scenarios including refactoring, code review, communication, and ATD evolution analysis.
    
    Conclusions
    With ATDx, we strive for the establishment of a sound, comprehensive, and intuitive architectural view of the ATD identifiable via source code analysis. The collected results are promising, and display both the representativeness and actionability of the approach. As future work, we plan to consolidate the approach via further empirical experimentation, by considering other development contexts (e.g., proprietary portfolios and other source code analysis tools), and enhancing the ATDx report capabilities.  </div>

   We propose a novel scalable approach for testing non-testable programs denoted as ARMED testing. The approach leverages effi- cient Association Rules Mining algorithms to determine relevant implication relations among features and actions observed while the system is in operation. These relations are used as the spec- ification of positive and negative tests, allowing for identifying plausible or suspicious behaviors: for those cases when oracles are inherently unknownable, such as in social testing, ARMED testing introduces the novel concept of testing for plausibility. To illustrate the approach we walk-through an application example.

  Context. With “work from home” policies becoming the norm during the COVID-19 pandemic, videoconferencing apps have soared in popularity, especially on mobile devices. However, mobile devices only have limited energy capacities, and their batteries degrade slightly with each charge/discharge cycle.
  Goal. With this research we aim at comparing the energy con- sumption of two Android videoconferencing apps, and studying the impact that different features and settings of these apps have on energy consumption.
  Method. We conduct an empirical experiment by utilizing as subjects Google Meet and Zoom. We test the impact of multiple factors on the energy consumption: number of call participants, microphone and camera use, and virtual backgrounds.
  Results. Zoom results to be more energy efficient than Google Meet, albeit only to a small extent. Camera use is the most energy greedy feature, while the use of virtual background only marginally impacts energy consumption. Number of participants affect differently the energy consumption of the apps. As exception, microphone use does not significantly affect energy consumption.
  Conclusions. Most features of Android videoconferencing apps sig- nificantly impact their energy consumption. As implication for users, selecting which features to use can significantly prolong their mobile battery charge. For developers, our results provide em- pirical evidence on which features are more energy-greedy, and how features can impact differently energy consumption across apps.

    A promise of cloud computing is the reduction of energy footprint enabled by economies of scale. Unfortunately, little research is available on how cloud consumers can reduce
their energy footprint when running software in the public cloud. Moreover, cloud consumers do not have full access to information regarding their cloud infrastructure usage, which is required to understand the impact of design decisions on energy usage. The purpose of our study is to support cloud consumers in developing energy-efficient workloads in the public cloud. To achieve our goal, we collaborated with a large cloud solution provider to discover an initial set of reusable architectural tactics for software
energy efficiency. Starting from interviews with 17 practitioners, we reviewed and selected available tactics to improve the energy efficiency of individual workloads in the public cloud, and synthetized the identified tactics in a reusable model. In addition, we conducted a case study to assess the impact of utilizing a tactic, which was selected following a prioritization provided by the practitioners. Our results demonstrate the possibility to architect cloud workloads for energy efficiency through reasoning and estimation of resource optimization. However, the process is not (yet) straightforward due to the current lack of transparency of cloud providers.

Architectural technical debt in software-intensive systems is a metaphor used to describe the “big” design decisions (e.g., choices regarding structure, frameworks, technologies, languages, etc.) that, while being suitable or even optimal when made, significantly hinder progress in the future. While other types of debt, such as code-level technical debt, can be readily detected by static analyzers, and often be refactored with minimal or only incremental efforts, architectural debt is hard to be identified, of wide-ranging remediation cost, daunting, and often avoided.

In this study, we aim at developing a better understanding of how software development organizations conceptualize architectural debt, and how they deal with it. In order to do so, in this investigation we apply a mixed empirical method, constituted by a grounded theory study followed by focus groups. With the grounded theory method we construct a theory on architectural technical debt by eliciting qualitative data from software architects and senior technical staff from a wide range of heterogeneous software development organizations. We applied the focus group method to evaluate the emerging theory and refine it according to the new data collected.

The result of the study, i.e., a theory emerging from the gathered data, constitutes an encompassing conceptual model of architectural technical debt, identifying and relating concepts such as its symptoms, causes, consequences, management strategies, and communication problems. From the conducted focus groups, we assessed that the theory adheres to the four evaluation criteria of classic grounded theory, i.e., the theory fits its underlying data, is able to work, has relevance, and is modifiable as new data appears.

By grounding the findings in empirical evidence, the theory provides researchers and practitioners with novel knowledge on the crucial factors of architectural technical debt experienced in industrial contexts.</div>

    Architectural technical debt (ATD) in a software-intensive system is the sum of all design choices that may have been suitable or even optimal at the time they were made, but which today are significantly impending progress: structure, framework, technology, languages, etc. Unlike code-level technical debt which can be readily detected by static analysers, and can often be refactored with minimal or only incremental efforts, architectural debt is hard to detect, and its remediation rather wide-ranging, daunting, and often avoided. The objective of this thesis is to develop a better understanding of architectural technical debt, and determine what strategies can be used to identify and manage it. In order to do so, we adopt a wide range of research techniques, including literature reviews, case studies, interviews with practitioners, and grounded theory. The result of our investigation, deeply grounded in empirical data, advances the field not only by providing novel insights into ATD related phenomena, but also by presenting approaches to pro-actively identify ATD instances, leading to its eventual management and resolution.

    Architectural technical debt (ATD) in software-intensive systems is mostly invisible to software de-velopers, can be widespread throughout entire code-bases, and its remediation cost is often steep.  Inrecent years, numerous approaches have been proposed to identify, keep track, and ultimately manageATD. The variety of approaches available opens a new problem, namely how to gain an encompassingoverview of the ATD identified in a software-intensive system. With this paper we make available theATDx tool, an implementation of ATDx written in Python, designed in a plug-in fashion.  ATDx is anapproach designed to provide a data-driven, intuitive, and actionable overview of the ATD present ina portfolio of software projects. ATDx is based on third-party source code analysis tools, architecturalissue severity calculationviaclustering, and aggregation of measurements into different architecturaltechnical debt dimensions. The ATDx tool allows users to automatically run the ATDx analysis, gener-ate reports containing the ATDx analysis results, and is integrated with GitHub. In addition to the tool,we provide two already implemented plugins, allowing users to run the ATDx tool out-of-the-box.

Background: With the rising popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI), there is a growing need to build large and complex AI-based systems in a cost-effective and manageable way. Like with traditional software, Technical Debt (TD) will emerge naturally over time in these systems, therefore leading to challenges and risks if not managed appropriately. The influence of data science and the stochastic nature of AI-based systems may also lead to new types of TD or antipatterns, which are not yet fully understood by researchers and practitioners. Objective: The goal of our study is to provide a clear overview and characterization of the types of TD (both established and new ones) that appear in AI-based systems, as well as the antipatterns and related solutions that have been proposed. Method: Following the process of a systematic mapping study, 21 primary studies are identified and analyzed. Results: Our results show that (i) established TD types, variations of them, and four new TD types (data, model, configuration, and ethics debt) are present in AI-based systems, (ii) 72 antipatterns are discussed in the literature, the majority related to data and model deficiencies, and (iii) 46 solutions have been proposed, either to address specific TD types, antipatterns, or TD in general. Conclusions: Our results can support AI professionals with reasoning about and communicating aspects of TD present in their systems. Additionally, they can serve as a foundation for future research to further our understanding of TD in AI-based systems.</div>

Context: Flaky tests plague regression testing in Continuous Integration environments by slowing down change releases and wasting testing time and effort. Despite the growing interest in mitigating the burden of test flakiness, how to efficiently and effectively detect flaky tests is still an open problem. Objective: In this study, we present and evaluate FLAST, an approach designed to statically predict test flakiness. FLAST leverages vector-space modeling, similarity search, dimensionality reduction, and k-Nearest Neighbor classification in order to timely and efficiently detect test flakiness. Method: In order to gain insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of FLAST, we conduct an empirical evaluation of the approach by considering 13 real-world projects, for a total of 1,383 flaky and 26,702 non-flaky tests. We carry out a quantitative comparison of FLAST with the state-of-the-art methods to detect test flakiness, by considering a balanced dataset comprising 1,402 real-world flaky and as many non-flaky tests. Results: From the results we observe that the effectiveness of FLAST is comparable with the state-of-the-art, while providing considerable gains in terms of efficiency. In addition, the results demonstrate how by tuning the threshold of the approach FLAST can be made more conservative, so to reduce false positives, at the cost of missing more potentially flaky tests. Conclusion: The collected results demonstrate that FLAST provides a fast, low-cost and reliable approach that can be used to guide test rerunning, or to gate the inclusion of new potentially flaky tests.</div>

Mobile platforms are rapidly and continuously changing, with support for new sensors, APIs, and programming abstractions. Static analysis is gaining a growing interest, allowing developers to predict properties about the run-time behavior of mobile apps without executing them. Over the years, literally hundreds of static analysis techniques have been proposed, ranging from structural and control-flow analysis to state-based analysis.
In this paper, we present a systematic mapping study aimed at identifying, evaluating and classifying characteristics, trends and potential for industrial adoption of existing research in static analysis of mobile apps. Starting from over 12,000 potentially relevant studies, we applied a rigorous selection procedure resulting in 261 primary studies along a time span of 9 years. We analyzed each primary study according to a rigorously-defined classification framework. The results of this study give a solid foundation for assessing existing and future approaches for static analysis of mobile apps, especially in terms of their industrial adoptability.
Researchers and practitioners can use the results of this study to (i) identify existing research/technical gaps to target, (ii) understand how approaches developed in academia can be successfully transferred to industry, and (iii) better position their (past and future) approaches for static analysis of mobile apps.</div>

Context: Tangled commits are changes to software that address multiple concerns at once. For researchers interested in bugs, tangled commits mean that they actually study not only bugs, but also other concerns irrelevant for the study of bugs.
Objective: We want to improve our understanding of the prevalence of tangling and the types of changes that are tangled within bug fixing commits.
Methods: We use a crowd sourcing approach for manual labeling to validate which changes contribute to bug fixes for each line in bug fixing commits. Each line is labeled by four participants. If at least three participants agree on the same label, we have consensus.
Results: We estimate that between 17% and 32% of all changes in bug fixing commits modify the source code to fix the underlying problem. However, when we only consider changes to the production code files this ratio increases to 66% to 87%. We find that about 11% of lines are hard to label leading to active disagreements between participants. Due to confirmed tangling and the uncertainty in our data, we estimate that 3% to 47% of data is noisy without manual untangling, depending on the use case.
Conclusion: Tangled commits have a high prevalence in bug fixes and can lead to a large amount of noise in the data. Prior research indicates that this noise may alter results. As researchers, we should be skeptics and assume that unvalidated data is likely very noisy, until proven otherwise.

Architectural technical debt (ATD) in software-intensive systems refers to the architecture design decisions which work as expedient in the short term, but later negatively impact system evolvability and maintainability. Over the years numerous approaches have been proposed to detect particular types of ATD at a refined level of granularity via source code analysis. Nevertheless, how to gain an encompassing overview of the ATD present in a software-intensive system is still an open question. In this study, we present a multi-step approach designed to build an ATD index (ATDx), which provides insights into a set of ATD dimensions building upon existing architectural rules by leveraging statistical analysis. The ATDx approach can be adopted by researchers and practitioners alike in order to gain a better understanding of the nature of the ATD present in software-intensive systems, and provides a systematic framework to implement concrete instances of ATDx according to specific project and organizational needs.

In this technical report we document a preliminary investigation carried out to evaluate the viability and the implementation feasibility of ATDx, and index designed to gain an overview of the architectural technical debt (ATD) present in a software-intensive system. We implement a prototype via the ATDx method by considering the source code static analysis tool SonarQube. This process is carried out by manually identifying 45 architectural rules, and subsequently applying the constructed prototype on a large-scale dataset composed of 6,706 open source Java-based projects. Among other results, this technical report provides insights into the benefits and drawbacks entailed by the concrete implementation of ATDx, the distribution of architectural debt across 6 distinct ATD dimensions (marked by the prominence of issues related to interfaces), and the correlation among the identified dimensions.

<div id="lago2020enviroinfo-abstract" class="abstract" style="display: none;">Scientific research addressing the relation between software and sustainability is slowly maturing in two focus areas, related to ‘sustainable software’ and ‘software for sustainability’. The first is better understood and may include research foci like energy efficient software and software maintainability. It most-frequently covers ‘technical’ concerns. The second, ‘software for sustainability’, is much broader in both scope and potential impact, as it entails how software can contribute to sustainability goals in any sector or application domain. Next to the technical concerns, it may also cover economic, social, and environmental sustainability.
Differently from researchers, practitioners are often not aware or well- trained in all four types of software sustainability concerns. To address this need, in previous work we have defined the Sustainability-Quality Assessment Framework (SAF) and assessed its viability via the analysis of a series of software projects. Nevertheless, it was never used by practitioners themselves, hence triggering the question: What can we learn from the use of SAF in practice? To answer this question, we report the results of practitioners applying the SAF to four industrial cases. The results show that the SAF helps practitioners in (1) creating a sustainability mindset in their practices, (2) uncovering the relevant sustainability-quality concerns for the software project at hand, and (3) reasoning about the inter-dependencies and trade-offs of such concerns as well as the related short- and long-term implications. Next to improvements for the SAF, the main lesson for us as researchers is the missing explicit link between the SAF and the (technical) architecture design.</div></li><br>

<div id="coro2020msr-abstract" class="abstract" style="display: none;">The recent push towards test automation and test-driven develop- ment continues to scale up the dimensions of test code that needs to be maintained, analysed, and processed side-by-side with pro- duction code. As a consequence, on the one side regression testing techniques, e.g., for test suite prioritization or test case selection, capable to handle such large-scale test suites become indispensable; on the other side, as test code exposes own characteristics, specific techniques for its analysis and refactoring are actively sought. We present JTeC, a large-scale dataset of test cases that researchers can use for benchmarking the above techniques or any other type of tool expressly targeting test code. JTeC collects more than 2.5M test classes belonging to 31K+ GitHub projects and summing up to more than 430 Million SLOCs of ready-to-use real-world test code.</div></li><br>

<div id="bertolino2020isti-abstract" class="abstract" style="display: none;">Flaky tests plague regression testing in Continuous Integration environments by slowing down change releases, wasting development effort, and also eroding testers trust in the test process. We present FLAST, the fast static approach to flakiness detection using test code similarity. Our extensive evaluation on 24 projects taken from repositories used in three previous studies showed that FLAST can identify flaky tests with up to 0.98 Median and 0.92 Mean precision. For six of those projects it could already yield ∼0.98 average precision values with a training set containing less than 100 tests. Besides, where known flaky tests are classified according to their causes, the same approach can also predict a flaky test category with alike precision values. The cost of the approach is negligible: the average train time over a dataset of ∼1,700 test methods is less than one second, while the average prediction time for a new test is less than one millisecond</div></li><br>

<div id="cruciani2019FASTR-abstract" class="abstract" style="display: none;">Test suite reduction approaches aim at decreasing software regression testing costs by selecting a representative subset from large-size test suites. Most existing techniques are too expensive for handling modern massive systems and moreover depend on artifacts, such as code coverage metrics or specification models, that are not commonly available at large scale. We present a family of novel very efficient approaches for similaritybased test suite reduction that apply algorithms borrowed from the big data domain together with smart heuristics for finding an evenly spread subset of test cases. The approaches are very general since they only use as input the test cases themselves (test source code or command line input). We evaluate four approaches in a version that selects a fixed budget B of test cases, and also in an adequate version that does the reduction guaranteeing some fixed coverage. The results show that the approaches yield a fault detection loss comparable to state-of-the-art techniques, while providing huge gains in terms of efficiency. When applied to a suite of more than 500K real world test cases, the most efficient of the four approaches could select B test cases (for varying B values) in less than 10 seconds.</div></li><br>

<div id="verdecchia2019icsa-abstract" class="abstract" style="display: none;">For surviving in the highly competitive market of Android apps, it is fundamental for app developers to deliver apps of high quality and with short release times. A well architected Android app is beneficial for developers, e.g. in terms of maintainability, testability, performance, and avoidance of resource leaks. However, how to properly architect Android apps is still debated and subject to conflicting opinions usually influenced by technological hypes rather than objective evidence. In this paper we present an empirical study on how developers architect Android apps, what architectural patterns and practices Android apps are based on, and their potential impact on quality. We apply a mixed-method empirical research design that combines (i) semi-structured interviews with Android practitioners in the field and (ii) a systematic analysis of both the grey (i.e., websites, on-line blogs) and white literature (i.e., academic studies) on the architecture of Android apps. Based on the analysis of the state of the art and practice about architecting Android apps, we systematically extract a set of 42 evidencebased guidelines supporting developers when architecting their Android apps.

<div id="verdecchia2018techdebt-abstract" class="abstract" style="display: none;">Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) regards sub-optimal design decisions that bring short-term benefits to the cost of long-term gradual deterioration of the quality of the software architecture. The identication of ATD strongly influences the technical and economic sustainability of software systems and is attracting growing interest in the scientific community. During the years several approaches for ATD identification have been conceived. Each of them, however, addresses ATD from different perspectives and with heterogeneous characteristics.
In this paper we present a systematic mapping study on ATD identification. Our goal is to identify, classify, and evaluate the state of the art on ATD identification from the following three perspectives: publication trends, characteristics, and potential for industrial adoption. Specifically, starting from a set of 509 potentially relevant studies, we systematically selected 47 primary studies and analyzed them according to a rigorously predefined classification framework.
The analysis of the obtained results will support both researchers and practitioners by providing (i) an assessment of current research trends and gaps in ATD identification, (ii) a solid foundation for understanding existing (and future) research, and (iii) a rigorous evaluation of its potential for industrial adoption.

<div id="malavolta2018icsme-abstract" class="abstract" style="display: none;">Context. Android is the largest mobile platform today, with thousands of apps published and updated in the Google Play store everyday. Maintenance is an important factor in Android apps lifecycle, as it allows developers to constantly expand their apps and better tailor them to their user base. <br>
Goal. In this paper we investigate the evolution of various maintainability issues along the lifetime of Android apps. <br>
Method. We designed and conducted an empirical study on 434 GitHub repositories containing open, real (i.e., published in the Google Play store), and actively maintained Android apps. We statically analyzed 9,945 weekly snapshots of all apps for identifying their maintainability issues over time. We also identified maintainability hotspots along the lifetime of Android apps according to how their density of maintainability issues evolves over time. More than 2,000 GitHub commits belonging to identified hotspots have been manually categorized to understand the context in which maintainability hotspots occur. <br>
Results. Our results shed light on (i) how often various types of maintainability issues occur over the lifetime of Android apps, (ii) the stationarity and trends maintainability issue density of Android apps over time, and (iii) an in-depth characterization of development activities related to maintainability hotspots. Conclusions. Independently from the type of development activ- ity, maintainability issues grow until they stabilize, but are never fully resolved. <br>

<div id="verdecchia2018codeSmells-abstract" class="abstract" style="display: none;">Software energy efficiency has gained the increasing attention of the research community. How to improve it, however, still lacks evidence. Specifically, the impact of code smell refactoring on energy efficiency has been scarcely investigated. In the exploratory study here reported, we investigate the impact on performance and energy consumption of refactoring well-known code smells on Java software applications. In order to understand if software metrics can be used as indicators of the energy impact of refactoring, we also measured the variation caused by refactoring on a set of well-established software metrics. We conducted a controlled experiment using state-of-the-art power measurement equipment. Statistical hypothesis testing and effect size estimation were performed on the experimental results, which show that in one out of three applications, refactoring each smell significantly impacted power- and energy consumption. E.g., refactoring Feature Envy and Long Method smells led to a 49% energy efficiency improvement. No software metric, however, significantly correlated with execution time, power or energy consumption. In conclusion, refactoring code smells resulted to be a viable process to significantly improve software energy efficiency. The magnitude of the impact may depend on application properties, e.g. size or age. Further research is needed
to understand the relationship between software metrics and energy efficiency.</div></li><br>

<div id="verdecchia2018enviroinfo-abstract" class="abstract" style="display: none;">With the growing adoption of ICT solutions, the requirement for developing energy efficient software becomes increasingly important. Current methods aimed at analyzing energy demanding portions of code, referred to as ``energy hotspots'', often require ad-hoc analyses that constitute an additional process in the development life cycle. This leads to the scarce adoption of such methods in practice, leaving an open gap between source code energy optimization research and its concrete application. Thus, our underlying goal is to provide developers with a technique that enables them to efficiently gather source code energy consumption information without requiring excessive time overhead and resources.
In this research we present a naive spectrum-based fault localization technique aimed to efficiently locate energy hotspots in source code. More specifically, our research aims to understand the viability of spectrum based energy hotspot localization and the tradeoffs which can be made between performance and precision for such techniques. Our naive yet effective approach takes as input an application and its test suite, and utilizes a simple algorithm to localize portions of code which are potentially energy-greedy. This is achieved by combining test case coverage information with runtime energy consumption measurements. The viability of the approach is assessed through an empirical experiment.
We conclude that the naive spectrum based energy hotspot localization approach can effectively support developers by efficiently providing insights of the energy consumption of software at source code level. Since we use processes already in place in most companies and adopt straightforward data analysis processes, naive spectrum based energy hotspot localization can reduce the effort and time required for assessing energy consumption of software and thus make including the energy consumption in the development process viable. As future work we plan to (i) further investigate the tradeoffs between performance and precision of spectrum based energy hotspot approaches (ii) compare our approach to similar ones through large-scale experiments. Our ultimate goal is to conceive ad-hoc tradeoff tuning of performance and precision according to development and organizational needs.</div></li><br>

<div id="verdecchia2018icsa-abstract" class="abstract" style="display: none;">In software-intensive systems, technical debt is a metaphor encompassing design and implementation constructs that are used as expedients in the short term, but that hinder future maintainability and evolvability. Architectural technical debt, in turn, adopts such concept by considering sub-optimal architectural design and implementation choices that bring short-term benefits to the cost of the long-term gradual deterioration of the quality of the software architecture.
Architectural technical debt is an active field of research. Nevertheless, how to accurately identify and manage architectural technical debt is still an open question. Our research aims to fill this gap. In particular, our goal is to: (i) consolidate the existing knowledge of architectural technical debt identification and its management in practice, (ii) conceive novel identification and management approaches built upon the existing state of the art techniques and industrial needs, and (iii) provide empirical evidence of architectural technical debt phenomena and assess the viability of the conceived approaches.
As a result, we envision a sound methodology aimed to support software architects in the identification and management of architectural technical debt throughout the software development process.</div></li><br>

<div id="miranda2018fast-abstract" class="abstract" style="display: none;">Many test case prioritization criteria have been proposed for speeding up fault detection. Among them, similarity-based approaches give priority to the test cases that are the most dissimilar from those already selected. However, the proposed criteria do not scale up to handle the many thousands or even some millions test suite sizes of modern industrial systems and simple heuristics are used instead. We introduce the FAST family of test case prioritization techniques that radically changes this landscape by borrowing algorithms commonly exploited in the big data domain to find similar items. FAST techniques provide scalable similarity-based test case prioritization in both white-box and black-box fashion. The results from experimentation on real world C and Java subjects show that the fastest members of the family outperform other black-box approaches in efficiency with no significant impact on effectiveness, and also outperform whitebox approaches, including greedy ones, if preparation time is not counted. A simulation study of scalability shows that one FAST technique can prioritize a million test cases in less than 20 minutes.</div></li><br>

<div id="verdecchia2017estimating-abstract" class="abstract" style="display: none;">Often motivated by optimization objectives, software products are characterized by different subsequent
releases and deployed through different strategies. The impact of these two aspects of software on energy consumption has still to be completely understood and can be improved by carrying out ad-hoc analyses for specific software products. In this research we report on an industrial collaboration aiming at assessing the different impact that releases and deployment strategies of a software product can have on the energy consumption of its underlying hardware infrastructure. We designed and performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment. Deployment strategies, releases and use case scenarios of an industrial third-party software product were adopted as experimental factors. The use case scenarios were used as a blocking factor and adopted to dynamically
load-test the software product. Power consumption and execution time were selected as response variables to measure the energy consumption. We observed that both deployment strategies and software releases significantly influence the energy consumption of the hardware infrastructure. A strong interaction between the two factors was identified. The impact of such interaction highly varied depending on which use case scenario was considered, making the identification of the most frequently adopted use case scenario critical for energy optimisation. The collaboration between industry and academia has been productive for both parties, even if some practitioners manifested low interest/awareness on software energy efficiency. For the software product considered there is no absolute preferable release or deployment strategy with respect to energy efficiency, as the interaction of these factors has to be considered. The number of machines involved in a software deployment strategy does not simply constitute an additive effect of the energy consumption of the underlying hardware infrastructure.</div></li><br>

<div id="verdecchia2017green-abstract" class="abstract" style="display: none;">Green ICT is a young and pioneering field. Therefore, as often pointed out in the literature, studies evaluating the main research activities and the general direction of this new and continuously evolving research field are scarce and often incomplete. This study presents a quantitative analysis, through a systematic literature review, of the main activities, trends and issues that can be found in the Green ICT literature. The research reports the analysis of various characteristics of the studies gathered for this review, such as addressed type of effect and year of publication. It also led to the identification of the most recurrent issues of the research and development of Green ICT strategies. Finally, this study proposes a new category of effect (people awareness) that, even if often addressed by the field, is not included in current Green ICT frameworks.</div></li><br>
